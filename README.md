# Learning stuff woo
Hopefully we get some nice version control learning done here. Also an introduction to some of the hip technologies available to us in the golden age of tech.

# Scripts
## Building
* For __development__: ```yarn start```
* For __production__: ```yarn build```
## Extras
* For __linting__: ```yarn lint```

# Technologies used
## CLI Tools
1. git - duh
2. Yarn - for installing and managing packages. You can also use ```npm``` but yarn is the new ```npm```. The ```yarn.lock``` file is a super cool feature of yarn since it prevents different users from experience different package and environment setups. It prevents the "it worked on my computer though?" when you change devices.

## Web
1. SASS - for more powerful CSS

## Build/Task Runner
1. Webpack

## Linting
1. ESLint - For standardized style throughout the project. You should be able to set up live time linting in your editor.
